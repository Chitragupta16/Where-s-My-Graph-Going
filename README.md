# Where Is My Graph Going?

An interactive graph visualization tool that lets you **see traversal algorithms in real time**.  
You can render a custom graph, choose an algorithm, and watch how it explores paths step by step.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

I built this project to better understand **how graph traversal and shortest-path algorithms actually work** beyond theory.  
Instead of just reading pseudocode, you can **watch nodes light up, paths form, and algorithms unfold** visually.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Custom Graph Input**: Define your own graph in adjacency list format.
- **Visualization**: Watch algorithms run step by step.
- **Speed Control**: Slow it down to study carefully or speed it up to see the big picture.
- **Algorithm Variety**:
  - Breadth First Search (BFS)
  - Depth First Search (DFS)
  - Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm
  - A* Search
  - Bellman-Ford Algorithm
  - Primâ€™s Algorithm
  - Kruskalâ€™s Algorithm

## How It Works

1. Enter a graph in adjacency list format
2. Click **Render Graph** to generate the visualization.
3. Select an algorithm from the dropdown.
4. Set a start (and end) node if required.
5. Click **Start Visualization** to see the algorithm in action.
6. Use **Pause** and **Reset** controls as needed.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5 Canvas** for graph rendering
- **JavaScript (ES6)** for algorithms and interactivity
- **CSS3** for UI styling

##  Future Improvements

- Add weighted graph input with edge costs
- Step-through mode (manual "next step" button)
- Export graph states as images or GIFs
